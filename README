PTC examples
============

The PTC examples are composed of binary configurations and demo applications.
The binary configurations have to be copied from the 'cfg' folder to the
'/lib/firmware/' folder of your target. The PTC firmware is also provided and
has to be copied in '/lib/firmware' as well.

Before running the application, you have to probe the atmel_ptc module with
the appropriate configuration.
