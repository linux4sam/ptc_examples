v1.1
====

Minor fixes for helper scripts and to check we are opening the input device
we expect.


v1.0
====

First release. Examples for ATQT1 self/mutual cap, ATQT2 and ATQT6 wings
using the libevdev (1.5.x) and gpiod (0.3.2) libraries.

Known issues:
- sensitivity too high for mutual capacitance wings.
- ATQT1 self capacitance: 'button 1' not working due to pinmuxing
constraints.
- ATQT1 mutual capacitance: 'led 5' and 'led 7' not working due to pinmuxing
constraints.
- board has to be rebooted when changing the wing.
