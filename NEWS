V1.3

Added support for SAMA5D27 WLSOM1 EK

v1.1
====

Minor fixes for helper scripts and to check we are opening the input device
we expect.


v1.0
====

First release. Examples for ATQT1 self/mutual cap, ATQT2 and ATQT6 wings
using the libevdev (1.5.x) and gpiod (0.3.2) libraries.

Known issues:

SAMA5D2 PTC EK
- sensitivity too high for mutual capacitance wings.
- ATQT1 self capacitance:
  - 'button 1' not working due to pinmuxing
constraints.
- ATQT1 mutual capacitance:
  - 'led 7' not working due to pinmuxing
constraints.
- board has to be rebooted when changing the wing.
